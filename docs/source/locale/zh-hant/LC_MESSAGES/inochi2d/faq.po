"**Nothing**, Inochi2D is free, BSD 2-clause licensed software. You may "
"download and use it at no cost, with the only limit being that you may "
"not remove the license text from the software. You can *optionally* "
"support the development monetarily via `Patreon "
"<https://patreon.com/LunaFoxgirlVT>`__ or `GitHub Sponsors "

"Inochi2D and the accompanying tools are still heavily work-in-progress. "
"They are usable for usecases we officially support, but it's still "
"evolving very quickly so we can't promise that it is ready for game "
"development. Some of the tooling is still a work in progress and will be "
"improved with time to be easier to use."

"Inochi Creator uses ImGui to render its UI, as of current ImGui does not "
"support dynamically loading glyphs from fonts, and loading every text "

" languages. Translations may specify metadata files with font and glyph "

"languages will only render properly if you set Inochi Creator to that "
"language. Inochi Creator does not support languages that require advanced"
" font shaping (eg. Arabic) as well as right-to-left languages currently "
